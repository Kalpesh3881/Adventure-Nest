-->express: This is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. 
It simplifies the process of building robust web applications by providing a set of features and tools for handling routes, managing middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses. 
Express is widely used in the Node.js ecosystem for building web servers and APIs.

-->mongoose: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
It provides a higher-level abstraction over the MongoDB Node.js driver, making it easier to interact with MongoDB databases.
Mongoose allows you to define schemas, models, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on MongoDB documents using JavaScript.

-->ejs: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine for Node.js. It allows you to embed JavaScript code directly within your HTML templates, making it easier 
to generate dynamic content on the server side. EJS templates can include variables, control structures, and partials, providing a flexible and powerful way
to generate HTML dynamically.


3. npm install -g nodemon  
-->nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected. 
It's commonly used during development to streamline the development process and avoid manual server restarts.

4. nodemon app.js -> To Start server

5. Database Connection String: mongodb://localhost:27017/AdventureNest
